# Introduction

Open Translation Alias (OT) a translator open to all people the intention
of this translator is to provide the experience of any web translator but
on your desktop it seems like a click because OT needs internet for its
operation, due to this defect OT provides (Will provide!) the
possibility to translate files not as you already do but intelligently
for greater comfort.

## OT Or An Online Translator

The answer is OT because any browser is heavier than OT (and more
slow), OT has a url to which it connects by default but this can be
personalize.

## OT is useful to me

The answer is yes, depending on whether you enter the following list:

 * I have a lot of information to translate and my browser is not the best
   tool for it.

 * It bothers me having to open my browser just to translate something.

 * I want a translator to save everything I translate.

 * I want a customizable translator.

 * I want a free software translator.

 * None of the above but OT is useful to me for some reason.

## To consider

Open Translation has not yet reached its first beta version, so
there could be errors in the future of this is to be a translator
smart, so that complex files can be translated into it, having a
voice translation extension, smart save; a better interface
